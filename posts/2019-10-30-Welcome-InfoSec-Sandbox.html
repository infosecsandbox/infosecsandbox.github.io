<h1>Welcome to InfoSec Sandbox</h1>

<p>This site is a space for me to document different projects I'm playing with. I should have documentation on home labs, PowerShell, blue and red team information security topics, Python, and much, much more.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The plan is to work through some intersting and fun projects and learn a TON. I'll explore on-prem, cloud, VM, and container environments.</blockquote>

<p>I hope to add value to the community. Feel free to reach out on Twitter with ideas for projects or to just chat.</p>
